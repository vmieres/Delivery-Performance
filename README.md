# Delivery-Performance
## Overview
This project analyzes truckload delivery performance data to validate customer claims, identify operational bottlenecks, and provide data-driven recommendations for supply chain optimization. Using Python and advanced data analytics techniques, this analysis examines over 60,000 delivery records to assess on-time performance, pinpoint problem locations, and diagnose root causes of delivery delays.

Key Business Questions Answered:       
Does the data support the customer's claim of 90% on-time performance?
Which delivery locations are the most problematic?
Are delivery time windows realistic for worst-performing locations?
### Business Problem
A logistics customer believes they mantain:
* 90% on-time delivery performance across their network
* Minimal delays of only "a couple of hours at most" when drivers are late

This analysis validates these claims and identifies areas for operational improvement using historical truckload data.
